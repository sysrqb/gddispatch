Dispatch - A web application to facilitate tracking the status of rides

INSTALLATION

  Dependencies:
    PHP 5.4.5 with mysqli

  This has only been tested with Lighttpd and Apache, but should work with
  Nginx without much difficulty.

  Apache:
    Place repo someplace useful. We placed it in /var/www, but the path
    doesn't matter as long as you make the proper modifications in the
    configuration file.

    In the Apache's config file, either add another VirtualHost if the server
    hosts multiple domains or adjust the Directives if you can:
    
      <Directory /var/www/>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
      </Directory>

    Everything will be served from this directory, so it's a simple setup.


  Lighttpy:
    Where ever the server has its document root set, i.e.:
    
        server.document-root = var.basedir + "/htdocs/dispatch"
    
    Place the repository there.



  Prerequisites to Use:
    Edit or create if it doesn't exist cred.local.php, it should look like:
    
      <?php
        $host = 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx';
        $username = 'dbuser';
        $password = 'dbuserpasswd';
        $db = 'dbname';
	$port = 3306;
        $CASserver = 'https://login.example.com';
        $CASValidateServer = "https://login.example.com/";
        $LocalAuthValidator = 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/auth.php';

        /* Setting this to true will allow easy access to the administration
	   screen
	 */
        $localadmin = TRUE;
      ?>

    - $host: IP Address of server hosting MySQL databas
    - $username: Username of user that has access to database and tables
    - $password: Users password (as above)
    - $db: Name of database
    - $port: Port the SQL Server listens on
    - $CASserver: CAS login URI 
    - $CASValidateServer: CAS validater URI
    - $LocalAuthValidator: URI to which successfully authenticated users
                           should be redirected


    When localadmin is set to TRUE, the administration panel is accessable
    using

      username: admin
      password: 1234

    This account should be disabled once CAS authentication is configured.
    To disable simply set

      $localadmin = FALSE

    in cred.local.php


  Setup:
    Once the necessary variables have been defined, run a web browser and go
    to the the URI http://example.com/login.php, but replace example.com
    with either the domain name or IP Address of the webserver hosting this
    webapp. If everything was set up correctly, the page should display a
    a login form prompting for a username and password.

    Assuming it is working, use the username admin and the password 1234
    to gain access to the admin panel. You should now see a page with the
    title Car Administration.

    We now need to create and initialize the database. Within the third box
    from the left, about halfway down, there is a line that says
    Initialie Database, click Initialize. On success the environment is ready
    for use.
