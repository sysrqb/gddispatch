General Idea/Flow

When a call is received, the dispatcher inputs the provided information.
Every field performs minimal validation, client-side. The phone number is
checked to ensure it is not a duplicate. If it is the dispatcher can then
inform the caller and has the option to override this restriction.

When the dispatcher submits the request, all required fields are verified 
to be filled. If one or more is empty, an alert pops-up displaying the 
empty required fields. 

Once all required fields are populated, the form is submitted and validation
takes place server side. If any check fails, the errors are displayed above 
the field.

If all fields validate successfully, the dispatcher and the ride are then moved
to the Waiting page where the ride can be assigned to a specific car. A 
suggestion will also be made based on the current location and/or destination
of the cars.

When a ride is assigned to a car, client side verifies that the car exists and
that the ride has not already been assigned to another car. If the ride has
been assigned, confirm reassignment.

On successful assignment, move ride to Assigned but leave dispatcher on Waiting 
page.

At this point, both the dispachers and Ride along, for the assigned car, have 
control of the ride information. When a modification is made, we store which 
fields were changed and by whom. This is done using a two byte entry in the
database where the first byte (MSB) is used for dispatch and second byte (LSB)
is used for modifcations made by GTB. Per byte, from MSb to LSb, the bits will 
be marked for Name, Cell phone number, number of riders, Pickup Location, Drop 
off location, Clothing, Notes, and Status. Using this information, if any
conflicting modifications are made then they will be displayed to the 
dispatchers on the Conflicts page. All non-conflicting modifications are 
successfully changed.
